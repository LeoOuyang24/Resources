stash@{1}: WIP on RenderOptimize: 718942e small optimization to ensure opaque sprites are not sorted by z
stash@{2}: filter-branch: rewrite
stash@{3}: WIP on master: 869573e New Physics section. ForcesComponent now no longer keeps track of all your forces but just has a single forces vector which decays over time; more realistic this way. Chain physics have been added although they currenlty function like they are underwater
stash@{4}: WIP on master: 869573e New Physics section. ForcesComponent now no longer keeps track of all your forces but just has a single forces vector which decays over time; more realistic this way. Chain physics have been added although they currenlty function like they are underwater
stash@{5}: WIP on master: 41df00e PolyRender no longer creates new arrays on the heap every iteration and instead uses the same vector, which is a slight optimization
